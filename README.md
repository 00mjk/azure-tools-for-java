# azure-tools-for-java
This is the repository for the open source portions of the source code for:
* [Azure Toolkit for Eclipse](#azure-toolkit-for-eclipse)
* [Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ IDEA](#azure-toolkit-for-intellij-idea)

The two projects use a lot of shared code and as of v2.8.2 (March release) are *equivalent* in functionality, hence the shared repo. 

## Azure Toolkit for Eclipse

### Installation:

* Eclipse marketplace: http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/azure-toolkit-eclipse
* Update site: http://dl.microsoft.com/eclipse 

### Documentation
* Specific to the Toolkit: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/azure-toolkit-for-eclipse/
* General about Java on Azure: http://azure.com/java
* [Getting-started tutorial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/create-a-hello-world-web-app-for-azure-in-eclipse/)

## Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ IDEA

### Installation
* [IntelliJ IDEA Plugin Repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8053?pr=idea)

### Documentation 
> :triangular_flag_on_post: Under construction. The functionality is the same as in the Azure Toolkit for Eclipse so you can refer to the [Eclipse plugins docs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/create-a-hello-world-web-app-for-azure-in-eclipse/) in the meantime, just remembering that "Project" in Eclipse means "Module" in IntelliJ, and "Workspace" in Eclipse means "Project" in IntelliJ.
